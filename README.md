Practical applications of machine learning techniques to real-world problems, focusing on data mining, recommendation systems, and adaptive interfaces.

## 📌 Project Overview

This course involved implementing a wide range of machine learning models from scratch and using industry-standard libraries. The curriculum covered everything from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to advanced deep learning techniques like Transfer Learning.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, OpenCV, Google Colab

## ✅ Completed Tasks

- **KNN Classification:** Performed EDA and implemented K-Nearest Neighbors on the Vertebral Column dataset.
- **Regression Analysis:** Built Linear, Multiple, and KNN Regression models with Hypothesis Testing.
- **Time Series Classification:** Extracted time-domain features and applied Bootstrapping on AReM data.
- **Supervised Learning:** Implemented Logistic Regression, Decision Trees (with Cost-complexity Pruning), and SVMs.
- **Ensemble Methods:** Applied Random Forest, XGBoost, and handled class imbalance using SMOTE.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Performed K-Means Clustering and Monte-Carlo Simulations on MFCC data.
- **Transfer Learning:** Developed a bird species image classifier using **EfficientNetB0** and **VGG16** architectures.
